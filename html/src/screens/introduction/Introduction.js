    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My name is Henrico Robinson.</p>

    <p>I've created some examples to illustrate my capabilities as a full-stack software developer.</p>

    <h2>Route Planner</h2>
    <p>This is a simple fictitious application that makes extensive use of Java EE and REST interfaces for the back-end, mainly using Spring-based frameworks.</p>

    <p>The user-interface is written in AngularJS using Bootstrap.</p>

    <h4>How to use it</h4>

    <p>It schedules routes for trade ships. Once all elements to a product shipping route have been added, can a schedule be created. The application determines the warehouse and ship that will fulfil and deliver the order in time based on speed and availability.
    </p>
    <h2>Neural Net</h2>
    <p>I've written a color scheme generator using a Perceptron Neural Network.</p>

    <p>This neural net learns how to generate a color scheme by analyzing the relationships between a color's red, green and blue values.</p>
