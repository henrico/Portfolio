<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My name is Henrico Robinson.</p>

<p>This project aims to illustrate my capabilities as a full-stack software developer.</p>
<p>It is a simple fictitious application for planning routes for trade ships, as well as a Neural Net for machine learning.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>The back-end is written in Java EE as REST interfaces and mainly uses Spring-based frameworks. Once all elements to a product shipping route have been added, can a schedule be created. The application determines the warehouse and ship that will fulfil and deliver the order in time based on speed and availability.</p>

<p>The user-interface is written in AngularJS using Bootstrap.</p>
